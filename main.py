# This module provides functionality to fetch and process weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It includes a function to retrieve weather information for a specified city, handling potential errors gracefully. The API key is securely loaded from an environment variable, ensuring that sensitive information is not hardcoded in the codebase.

In this function, we wrap the API call in a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur during the request or data processing. If an error occurs, we print a message indicating the error and return None, allowing the calling code to handle the situation appropriately.
